Predictive modeling of sea turtle nesting using tidal and lunar factors

# Olive Ridley Sea Turtle Nesting Prediction Model

This repository contains statistical models to predict:

1. Daily sea turtle nest counts
2. Probability of high nesting events

## Modeling Approach

- Negative Binomial regression for daily count
- Logistic regression for high nesting probability
- Tide height
- Tide timing
- Lunar phase (cyclical encoding)
- Seasonal quadratic trend

## Requirements
pandas
numpy
statsmodels
